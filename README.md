# Test suites for Cat API
The repository contains a pet project with test suites for a public API [Cat_API](https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t). This API inculdes a lot of cat images, fun facts about cats and their breeds.
Tests coveres three main modules:
-	a test for an uploading cat image (uploading, checking, deleting);
-	a test for adding pictures to favourites (adding, checking, removing from favourites);
- a test for voting for the pictures (voting, checking, deleting votes).
This project is created on the Python language using the Requests library.
